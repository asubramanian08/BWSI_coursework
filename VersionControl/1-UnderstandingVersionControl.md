# What is Version Control and Why Do I Need It?

Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-O8ZNW9icQ

Notes:
- Each project is just a series of changes: new versions
- Git allows you to store and manage past versions of your project
- Folders:
    - Don't help you see what has changed
    - You copy the whole project over and over
- For each new version:
    - Who made the change
    - What was changed
    - When was it changed
    - Commit message
- Easy to restore versions of your project and use different branches

    Branches are independent lines of development
- Version control also helps you collaborate with others
- Side effect: Each person has their own backup of the project

# What are Git and GitHub?

Source: https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/

Notes:
- Git is a version control system that tracks changes in a project
- This promotes collaboration and helps you manage your project
- Distributed version control system: Each developer has a full copy of the project

    People don't need constant access to a central server
- Github is a hosting service for Git repositories

    It allows for pull requests and issues and other sorts of things
- Repository: A folder that contains all of the files for a git project
- Branch: A parallel version of a repository
